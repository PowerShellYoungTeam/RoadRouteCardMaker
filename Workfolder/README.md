# RoadRouteCardMaker

This project demonstrates multiple ways to create a truck route card:

1. **Web App (React)**: A simple web application for creating and printing route cards.
2. **Desktop App (Electron)**: A desktop application for offline route card creation.
3. **Command-Line Tool (Python)**: A script to generate route cards from the terminal.
4. **Spreadsheet Template**: An Excel template for manual entry and printing.

Each option is in its own folder with a README explaining how to use it.
